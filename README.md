Repository that gets the recipes from Santa Receita and export them as pdf.
My grandma loves [Santa Receita's](https://www.a12.com/santareceita) recipes and watch them every single day on TV. However, it's too fast to her to take notes of the recipes and the program's website isn't exactly user friendly when it comes to printing the recipes. So, to ease up my life and make my grandma happy I did this.
